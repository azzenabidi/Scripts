Introduction
====

I started this repo privately 3 years ago to keep track of my web scraping scripts I was writing on the job at the time. It was never a requirement. It was just an enhancement in the way I handled manual data entry and spreadsheet.

Overtime, I kept adding to this repo and although I originally started with python, I decided eventually to migrate most of the scripts to ruby.

Description

Each folder name classifies scripts by category.
